        <h2 class="can2">This is a small section of the FAQs about COVID-19. You can find the extensive list found on
          Nashville's Government website <a href="https://www.asafenashville.org/questions-answers/">here</a> along with
          additional information provided by the Government.

      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">What is the novel coronavirus COVID-19?</h2>
        <p>The coronavirus you are hearing about — COVID-19 — is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to
          person. It was first discovered in China in late 2019.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">How serious is COVID-19?</h2>
        <p>The severity of the illness varies from person to person.</p>
        <p>For many people, the virus will not lead to any serious complications or hospitalization, but some cases can
          lead to pneumonia or even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires a patient to be put on a
          ventilator with oxygen. If the lungs are damaged and insufficient oxygen reaches the rest of the body,
          respiratory failure can lead to organ failure and death.</p>
        <p>People with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions (such as heart disease, liver
          disease, diabetes, or respiratory illness) and those older than 60 are most at risk of serious infection.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">How is COVID-19 spread?</h2>
        <p>The virus is spread mainly from person-to-person contact – like shaking hands – and through respiratory
          droplets produced when someone with the virus sneezes or coughs.</p>
        <p>The virus can remain on objects or surfaces touched by someone with COVID-19. If you touch a contaminated
          object or surface and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, the virus can spread to you.</p>
        <p>Most early cases of COVID-19 in the United States were associated with travel in countries where the virus
          was more prevalent. Increasingly, however, the virus is “community-acquired” — caught through close contact
          with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">Who is at risk for COVID-19?</h2>
        <p>People with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions (such as heart disease, liver
          disease, diabetes, or respiratory illness), and those older than 60, are at higher risk for developing more
          serious complications from COVID-19.</p>
        <p>
          That said, all people, regardless of risk factor, should take preventive measures to reduce the spread of
          illness. COVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning about it.
        </p>

      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">What is social distancing?
        </h2>
        <p>Social distancing means maintaining a greater than usual physical distance from other people or avoiding
          direct contact with people or objects in public places during the outbreak of a contagious disease in order to
          minimize exposure and reduce the transmission of infection.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">What is flattening the curve?
        </h2>
        <p>By taking community isolation measures, we can keep the daily number of disease cases at a manageable level
          for medical providers. A slower infection rate means a less stressed health care system, fewer hospital visits
          on any given day and fewer sick people being turned away.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">How often do I need to wash my hands?</h2>
        <p>Wash your hands before you leave the house, so as not to spread your household germs, and once you arrive at
          your destination to remove germs picked up on the way, from doors, elevator buttons, or your vehicle.</p>
        <p>Wash your hands before and after you prepare food and before and after you eat.</p>
        <p>Wash your hands after cleaning objects or surfaces.</p>
        <p>Wash your hands before and after tending to your child.</p>
        <p>Wash your hands after touching a shopping cart, basket or other common surface; after you use the bathroom,
          blow your nose, cough or sneeze.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">Do I have to wear a face mask to protect myself from COVID-19?</h2>
        <p>The CDC recommends wearing face masks or cloth face coverings in public to slow the spread of the virus, and
          help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings
          fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional,
          voluntary public health measure.</p>
        <p>
          Please do not wear surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be
          reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-12 cell">
        <h2 class="can2">What should I do if I am sick?</h2>
        <p>Do not go to work, school or any other public places.</p>
        <p>As with many other viruses, you need to rest, drink fluids and control fever to help relieve symptoms.</p>
        <p>If you have symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath), self-quarantine
          and contact your health care provider or call the Metro Public Health Department COVID-19 Hotline at
          615-862-7777 (7 a.m. – 7 p.m., daily).</p>
        <p>If you are sick but do not have symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of
          breath), stay home and rest – unless you need to get medical care. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19,
          self-quarantine and contact your health care provider or Metro’s COVID-19 Hotline.</p>
        <p>Separate yourself from other people in your home. Avoid sharing household items with others in your home.</p>
        <p>If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, a severe headache or other potentially
          life-threatening problems, go to the nearest emergency department or call 911.</p>
